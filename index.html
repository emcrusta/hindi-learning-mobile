					<h3>An Introduction to Hindi</h3>
					<p>
						So do you think you are ready to begin your adventure in
						Learning Hindi? Excellent! Remember that although
						learning a language fluently may take years, it is only
						ever one small step at a time. The Indian flag - Hindi
						is mainly spoken in the northern areas of India. On this
						page you’ll find the background information about Hindi
						simply to give you more of an idea about what Hindi
						really is and to let you know some of the things you’ll
						be learning.

					<h3>Lesson #1: Saying Hello</h3>

						word, नमस्ते namaste - Hello. Click the link above to go
						to Lesson #1. Think you can remember that? Excellent!
						Now we’re going to learn some really simple facts about
						Hindi…

						worry, I will make it and as simple, as easy and, most
						importantly, as fun as possible. Got that? Great! Now,
						you may have noticed that Hindi is written in a very
						strange looking alphabet, this is known as Devanagari.

						Conversational Phrases and Grammar Rules! Try reading
						one lesson from each topic at a time! Actually being

						well into any particular section; The Urdu Section How
